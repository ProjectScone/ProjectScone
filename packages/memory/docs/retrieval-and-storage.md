# Recall semantics, storage and recovery

[Package overview](../README.md) · [Architecture](../ARCHITECTURE.md)

Examples below run from `packages/memory/` unless a section names another working directory.

## What recall returns

Items carry `score` (rank within this query; the top item is always 1.0)
and `similarity` (cosine from the vector lane, when that lane saw the
chunk). Two lanes, vector and lexical, are fused by reciprocal rank with a
small recency term, capped at two chunks per episode. A lane that fails is
named in `degraded` and the other lane still answers. `context_reduction`
is the share of the space's bytes that were left behind.

`top_similarity` is the best cosine the vector lane saw for the query.
With `SCONE_SIMILARITY_FLOOR` set (a cosine, e.g. `0.45`), a recall whose
best hit falls below it, or that finds nothing, carries
`low_confidence: true` so the reader can decline to answer from weak
evidence; without a floor the field is `null` and nothing is judged. The
floor has no default because the right value depends on the embedder:
`scone-memory bench` prints, for each candidate floor, how many
no-evidence questions it would catch and how many answerable ones it
would wrongly withhold, and that sweep is where a floor comes from.

`history=true` (CLI `--history`) adds, for every matched fact, the closed
facts that held before it for the same subject and predicate, oldest
first, each with its interval and closing reason, bounded by `as_of`.

## What survives a crash

A `remember` marks the episode's identity in the document store before
it writes, and clears the mark only after the rows and the vectors are
all durable. On the next open the engine finishes or forgets whatever
was cut off in between: chunks are rebuilt from the stored content when
they are missing, vectors are re-embedded when they are missing, and a
mark with no episode behind it is dropped. Each open that had anything
to repair records one `recover` event with the counts. The guarantee:
an episode you can see is complete, or it is absent; it is never
searchable by one lane and not the other. This holds on every document
store below (the recovery contract in `tests/memory/test_contract.py` plays the
crash at each step of the write).

## Stores and what each one promises

The following description and table retain the original validation record,
not a current test count or a guarantee that every optional service ran in a
particular CI invocation:

> Every store below runs the same 37 contract tests (`tests/memory/test_contract.py`)
> and every evidence sink the same 8 (`tests/memory/test_events.py`). "Verified"
> says how: embedded means in-process in the test suite and CI; container
> means against a real server in Docker locally and as a CI service.

Consult [current measurements and their scope](scaling-validation.md) separately.

Query terms come from one shared tokenizer, `retrieval.lexical.tokenize`.
A term is a run of letters, combining marks and digits in any script, after
NFKC normalisation and case folding, so "Zürich", "हिन्दी" and "ＡＢＣ" stay
whole; underscores still split words. Scripts written without spaces
(Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Lao, Khmer, Myanmar) become overlapping
pairs of characters. The in-process BM25 lane, SQLite's fact index and the
hash embedder match those pairs directly. Stores that tokenize documents
themselves do not: SQLite FTS5 and PostgreSQL keep a whole unspaced run as
one token, so their chunk lanes still cannot match inside Chinese or
Japanese text, and Elasticsearch's standard analyzer re-splits the pairs by
its own Unicode word rules, so matches there are looser. Anything that stores tokens or values hashed from them
records `TOKENIZER_VERSION`; SQLite rebuilds its fact index when that
version or Python's Unicode tables change.

Intentional differences: lexical scores are each store's own (BM25,
`$text`, `ts_rank`); only their order reaches the shared fusion algorithm.
Both rankings and raw scores can differ across stores. Retention is a TTL
index on MongoDB and a clock-driven sweep elsewhere. No store migrates
another build's data: each stamps a schema version and refuses a
mismatch, SQLite excepted for the one recorded step.

## Which embedder wrote the vectors

A cosine means something only between vectors that one embedder made under
one set of settings, and a vector's width cannot tell two embedders apart.
SQLite and in-memory vector indexes record their writer: the embedder id
plus whether contextual prefixes were embedded. The hash embedder's id also
names the tokenizer version and Python's Unicode tables, because its vectors
are hashed tokens.

The record is kept true. Every vector write checks it in the same
transaction (SQLite takes its write lock first). A write by a different
embedder turns the record to `mixed` instead of leaving another writer's
name over vectors it did not make. A rebuild marks the index `rebuilding`
before its first write, and records its writer only if that marker is still
there at the end. The engine reads the record before every recall and every
semantic duplicate search, not only when it opens, so an engine that
another process rebuilt underneath stops trusting its vectors at once.

| State | Meaning | Vector lane |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `verified` | The index records this engine's writer | on |
| `rebuilt` | This engine re-embedded every stored chunk and recorded itself | on |
| `declared` | An operator vouched for vectors stored before writers were recorded | on |
| `mismatch` | Another writer is recorded | off |
| `unknown` | Some vectors have no recorded writer | off |
| `mixed` | Vectors from more than one writer | off |
| `interrupted` | A rebuild began and never finished | off |
| `unverifiable` | The index cannot record a writer | on, as before |

With the lane off, recall still answers from the lexical lane and names the
reason in `degraded` (for example `vectors: embedder mixed: …`), and
semantic duplicate detection refuses rather than comparing. The hash
embedder is local, free and deterministic, so a store it cannot trust is
re-embedded on open, like a derived index. Any other embedder may be slow or
paid, so it is rebuilt only on request:

```bash
scone vectors            # state, recorded writer, this engine's writer
scone vectors --reembed  # re-embed every stored chunk, drop orphan vectors, record the writer
scone vectors --adopt    # vouch for vectors no one recorded (recorded as declared)
```

The same operations are `MemoryEngine.reembed_vectors()`,
`MemoryEngine.adopt_vector_identity()` and `MemoryEngine.check_vectors()`.
An interrupted rebuild is simply run again. `--adopt` applies only to
`unknown` vectors, and only if any vectors written since then came from this
same embedder; a recorded different writer, a mix or an unfinished rebuild
can only be rebuilt. If another embedder writes during a rebuild, the
rebuild fails with `VectorWriterChanged` and the record stays `mixed`.

Other vector indexes (Qdrant, Chroma, LanceDB, Milvus, PostgreSQL, Redis,
Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, ElastiCache and bridged LangChain stores) do not
yet record a writer. They report `unverifiable` and keep their previous
behaviour, so switching embedders on them still requires emptying or
rebuilding the index yourself.

## Indexed fact recall

SQLite accelerates lexical fact lookup with a derived token index. Query token
overlap, confidence/ID ordering, historical validity, and source filters retain
the ledger scan's semantics. Facts outside the requested source scope cannot
consume the result limit. The engine checks returned facts against current ledger
records; an unavailable or invalid index falls back to scanning and reports
`fact_index: unavailable` in recall degradation. Other document stores retain
their existing scan unless they implement the optional `IndexedFactSearch` port.

SQL triggers record fact edits made by older clients as well as this library.
The next lookup refreshes pending terms for that space. Existing databases incur
an initial backfill; missing or incompatible derived objects are rebuilt on open.
The index does not change the ledger schema version. Historical-chain retrieval
still scans, and common query terms can still require sorting many matching
postings. This index does not accelerate vector retrieval or model generation.

Measure exact result parity and warm lookup latency on disposable synthetic
ledgers, with initial indexing reported separately:

```sh
python -m scone_memory.testing.fact_search_benchmark \
  --sizes 1000 10000 50000 --repeats 5 --output /path/to/new-report.json
```

The diagnostic includes sparse terms, common terms, and a source filter that
rejects most higher-ranked matches. It reports full ledger rows materialized and
fact point reads; it does not claim constant-time lookup or generation accuracy.
No model, network connection, or application database is used.
