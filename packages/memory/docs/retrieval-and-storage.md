# Recall semantics, storage and recovery

[Package overview](../README.md) · [Architecture](../ARCHITECTURE.md)

Examples below run from `packages/memory/` unless a section names another working directory.

## What recall returns

Items carry `score` (rank within this query; the top item is always 1.0)
and `similarity` (cosine from the vector lane, when that lane saw the
chunk). Two lanes, vector and lexical, are fused by reciprocal rank with a
small recency term, capped at two chunks per episode. A lane that fails is
named in `degraded` and the other lane still answers. `context_reduction`
is the share of the space's bytes that were left behind.

`top_similarity` is the best cosine the vector lane saw for the query.
With `SCONE_SIMILARITY_FLOOR` set (a cosine, e.g. `0.45`), a recall whose
best hit falls below it, or that finds nothing, carries
`low_confidence: true` so the reader can decline to answer from weak
evidence; without a floor the field is `null` and nothing is judged. The
floor has no default because the right value depends on the embedder:
`scone-memory bench` prints, for each candidate floor, how many
no-evidence questions it would catch and how many answerable ones it
would wrongly withhold, and that sweep is where a floor comes from.

`history=true` (CLI `--history`) adds, for every matched fact, the closed
facts that held before it for the same subject and predicate, oldest
first, each with its interval and closing reason, bounded by `as_of`.

## What survives a crash

A `remember` marks the episode's identity in the document store before
it writes, and clears the mark only after the rows and the vectors are
all durable. On the next open the engine finishes or forgets whatever
was cut off in between: chunks are rebuilt from the stored content when
they are missing, vectors are re-embedded when they are missing, and a
mark with no episode behind it is dropped. Each open that had anything
to repair records one `recover` event with the counts. The guarantee:
an episode you can see is complete, or it is absent; it is never
searchable by one lane and not the other. This holds on every document
store below (the recovery contract in `tests/memory/test_contract.py` plays the
crash at each step of the write).

## Stores and what each one promises

The following description and table retain the original validation record,
not a current test count or a guarantee that every optional service ran in a
particular CI invocation:

> Every store below runs the same 37 contract tests (`tests/memory/test_contract.py`)
> and every evidence sink the same 8 (`tests/memory/test_events.py`). "Verified"
> says how: embedded means in-process in the test suite and CI; container
> means against a real server in Docker locally and as a CI service.

Consult [current measurements and their scope](scaling-validation.md) separately.

| Store | Documents | Vectors | Evidence | Verified | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| in-memory | yes | yes | yes | embedded | reference implementation |
| SQLite | yes | yes | yes | embedded | FTS5 lexical lane; WAL; schema stamped, additive steps from v5 (quote column, inflight table) |
| MongoDB | yes | | yes | container (local; CI when `SCONE_TEST_MONGO_URL` is set) | `$text` lexical lane; TTL retention |
| PostgreSQL + pgvector | yes | yes | yes | container | tsvector lexical lane, HNSW cosine, one pool for all three |
| Elasticsearch 8 | yes | yes | yes | container | BM25 lexical lane, float32 HNSW (int8 would round cosine), refresh per write |
| Qdrant | | yes | | embedded (local mode) and container | payload filters server-side |
| Redis Stack | | yes | | container | TAG/NUMERIC prefilters inside the KNN query |
| Chroma | | yes | | embedded; server by URL | width recorded in collection metadata |
| LanceDB | | yes | | embedded | SQL predicates, quotes doubled |
| Milvus | | yes | | embedded (Milvus Lite); server by URI | filter expressions with JSON literals |
| any LangChain VectorStore | | yes | | embedded (`InMemoryVectorStore`, FAISS) | needs a `filter_builder` and a stated `score`; see [the bridge guide](integrations.md#any-langchain-vectorstore-as-the-vector-index) |

Intentional differences: lexical scores are each store's own (BM25,
`$text`, `ts_rank`); only their order reaches the shared fusion algorithm.
Both rankings and raw scores can differ across stores. Retention is a TTL
index on MongoDB and a clock-driven sweep elsewhere. No store migrates
another build's data: each stamps a schema version and refuses a
mismatch, SQLite excepted for the one recorded step.

## Indexed fact recall

SQLite accelerates lexical fact lookup with a derived token index. Query token
overlap, confidence/ID ordering, historical validity, and source filters retain
the ledger scan's semantics. Facts outside the requested source scope cannot
consume the result limit. The engine checks returned facts against current ledger
records; an unavailable or invalid index falls back to scanning and reports
`fact_index: unavailable` in recall degradation. Other document stores retain
their existing scan unless they implement the optional `IndexedFactSearch` port.

SQL triggers record fact edits made by older clients as well as this library.
The next lookup refreshes pending terms for that space. Existing databases incur
an initial backfill; missing or incompatible derived objects are rebuilt on open.
The index does not change the ledger schema version. Historical-chain retrieval
still scans, and common query terms can still require sorting many matching
postings. This index does not accelerate vector retrieval or model generation.

Measure exact result parity and warm lookup latency on disposable synthetic
ledgers, with initial indexing reported separately:

```sh
python -m scone_memory.testing.fact_search_benchmark \
  --sizes 1000 10000 50000 --repeats 5 --output /path/to/new-report.json
```

The diagnostic includes sparse terms, common terms, and a source filter that
rejects most higher-ranked matches. It reports full ledger rows materialized and
fact point reads; it does not claim constant-time lookup or generation accuracy.
No model, network connection, or application database is used.
